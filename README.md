### Goals

-   Complete the Python Bootcamp:go from zero to hero in python 3

### Boundaries / Scope

-   Complete Bootcamp Course

### Success criteria

-   My own understanding and proficiency with python.
-   Weekly work log with screenshots and summaries to demonstrate activity.

### Constraints

-   Majority of income comes from me so I spend at least 20 hours working and have 3 other courses I am taking not including this one.

### Assumptions

-   The courses will be available for the duration of the semester.
-   I have all required software.
-   I can skip the Installing and Using Python units.

### Stakeholders

-   Professor - for grade
-   Myself - investing in my education and future success, and using my GI Bill
-   Perspective Employers - artifact will be added to my student portfolio which could help with getting a job

2. learned how to assign variables
3. learned how to make strings and to index and slice them.
4. learned how to use print statements
5. learned how to make lists and dictionaries and the differences between them, along with pros and cons of each.
6. Learned how to create dictionaries and retrieve elements using keys.
7. learned the difference between tuples and lists and where one might be more useful than the other.
8. Learned how to make True or False statements (Booleans)
9. learned how to create sets
10. Learned input and output of basic files in python, that let me create, write, and read text files.
11. Took a comprehension test on sections 1-4 of the Udemy Python bootcamp

Week 3

1. Learned about Comparison operators and how to Chain them with Logic statements ( ==, !=, <, >, <=, >=, and, or, not)
2. Learned about if, elif, and else logic statements and their uses with booleans.
3. Learned about for loops and how to use them in lists, tuples, and dictionaries. Along with proper indentation.
4. Learned about methods and how to find what i can do and what that method does by asking for help(). Also where and how to access documentation on Python.

Week 4

1. Learned how to create and define a function and its uses.
2. Learned how to use arguements and keyword arguements in a function to add an arbitrary number of items through the function.
3. Learned about Lambda functtions, along with the map, Scope, and filter.
4. Through two assignments I learned about nested functions and the LEGB rule for scope.

Week 5

1. Created Tic Tac toe game that let 2 players make inputs, selected a random player to go first, displayed a board with the accroding moves, and asked if ou wanted to replay.

Week 6

1. Learned how to create a Class and the init function, along with throwing basic methods in there to self reference objects.

Week 7

1. Learned how to use Try, Except, and Final for error handling.
2. Learned how to create modules and pull specific packages from it.
3. Learned how to use Pylint to 'Grade" code
4. Learned how to use Unittest to make and run test code for main/specific code.

Week 8

1.Created a Black Jack game using OOP, loops, and dictionaries.

Week 9
1. Learned to create a decorator that you can turn on and off so to easily run functions as an arguement for another function.
2. Learned to create a generator so to not use too much memory to save a big list but instead have the computer remember the last spot and spit out an item as i ask for it.
3. Then i had a "homework" assignment using both decorators and generator.
